        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Have you ever been falsely accused? Been wronged because the other party did not
            know what you have done? Well I have. I have always been a diligent student, doing all
            my homework before playing games or watching cute dog videos on Youtube. However,
            my parents (or guardian for this matter) always comes in the wrong moments to see me always
            playing and never studying. My guardians always have bad timing to come check on me to see me shouting
            at my friend across the web. When I am studying, they do not come in at all.</p>
        <p>So what do I do? Should I then study 24/7 so that they can finally "catch" me studying?</p>
        <p>NO</p>
        <p>I'm an engineer and we solve problem by creating products, so I have decided to make a notification system
            that
            will notify me when someone is entering my room (NOTE: There was another problem on how they can come in
            without me knowing too, so
            now I'm going to solve 2 problem with 1 solution)</p>
        <p>The system will be an Arduino shield that uses ultrasonic sensor to act as the "invisible tripwire" and a
            buzzer to notify me.</p>

        <h3>Component List</h3>
        <p>You would need...</p>
        <p>1x Arduino Uno</p>
        <p>1x Stripboard (at least 15 holes by 20 holes)</p>
        <p>1x 8pin leg</p>
        <p>2x 6pin leg</p>
        <p>1x Buzzer</p>
        <p>1x 2N222 BJT Transistor</p>
        <p>1x 330Ω resistor</p>
        <p>1x 1kΩ resistor</p>
        <p>1x Potentiometer (10kΩ)</p>
        <p>1x Ultrasonic sensor</p>
        <p>1x 9V battery</p>
        <p>A bunch of wire (not really actually, but oh well)</p>

        <h3>The S.H.I.E.L.D</h3>
        <p>For those who are curious how we are going to wire the individual components,
            here are the schematic for the individual parts namely the buzzer and
            the potentiometer (ultrasonic sensor just plug and play so no schematic)</p>
        <img class="img" src="../assets/invisible_tripwire_alarm/Schematic1.png" alt="1st schematic" id="blogImg">
        <p>The above is the schematic for the buzzer. Transistor to control the current flow
            resistor to limit the current to protect the buzzer</p>
        <img class="img" src="../assets/invisible_tripwire_alarm/Schematic2.png" alt="2nd schematic" id="blogImg">
        <p>Here the second one is the potentiometer schematic, we will be using the analog
            reader on the Arduino to read the voltage level across the 1kΩ resistor. (Any value is ok,
            but 1k so we have a nicer gradient when varying the potentiometer which is 10kΩ</p>
        <p>Now with everything that you have, you can start soldering everything onto the stripboard</p>
        <img class="img" src="../assets/invisible_tripwire_alarm/Schematic3.png" alt="3rd schematic" id="blogImg">
        <p>The "x"s on the board are holes that needs to be drilled onto the copper lanes to prevent them
            from conducting</p>
        <p>Lines are wires, and the tiny squares are the connection to the Arduino</p>
        <p>If you are too lazy and have a PCB miller at home, here: <a href="resources/EA.brd">PCB design</a></p>

        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>After you have soldered everything to the stripboard (or PCB), you can now plug it on top of an Arduino,
            plug in the Buzzer and power supply and load in the code below</p>
        <pre>
        <div class="code">
#include &lt;Ultrasonic.h&gt;

const int pin = 5;  //Transistor Control Pin
Ultrasonic ultrasonic(7, 6); //Initialise Ultrasonic
int threshold = 0;  //Distance Threshold variable

void setup() {
pinMode(A4, INPUT); //Set A4 as Analog Read
pinMode(pin, OUTPUT); //Set pin 5 as output

Serial.begin(9600); // Starts the serial communication
}

void loop() {
int value = analogRead(A4); //Read from A4
int distance = ultrasonic.distanceRead(); //Read from ultrasonic sensor

threshold = map(value, 100, 1000, 5, 100); //Map threshold sensitivity

//Print out all data
Serial.print("Distance = ");
Serial.print(distance);
Serial.print(", Threshold = ");
Serial.println(threshold);

if (distance > threshold)
{
//Buzzer Off
digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
}
else if (distance < threshold && distance > 0)
{
//Trigger Buzzer
digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);
}
else  //when Ultrasonic sensor does not sense anything
{
//Buzzer Off
digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
}
}
