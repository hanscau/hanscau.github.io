			<h3>Preface (a.k.a grandmother story)</h3>
			<p>
				This post is created during a time on uncertainty. Where
				everyone is stuck at home and it required by law to be stuck at
				home. Is it the apocalypse? No, is it the zombies? Not either.
				It's worst, it's a virus outbreak. Worst because at least
				apocalypse or a zombie attack would have been much cooler (at
				least in my ungrateful mind) and we could have been allowed to
				raid NTUC (Is THAT not fun?). But yes, during this time, the
				worst enemy (at least for those who are not battling the virus
				that is) is boredom. So in an effort to do what I can to help
				even a tiny bit in this crisis, I've decided to port a board
				game that my church wanted to play online (Is it even legal?
				Probably not, but we did have a proper physical copy of the
				game... so.... yeah...).
			</p>

			<p>
				The publisher of the game have a very nice tutorial on how to
				play the game, so I'll just link their youtuber right here:
				<a target="_new" href="https://youtu.be/gP5j9n7WJ5k"
					>Codenames: Pictures - Official Rules Video</a
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				But in a nutshell, the game is setup with a 4 by 5 grid of
				interesting pictures on the table. There are two teams and each
				team has at least 1 spymaster. These spymasters are given a map
				that maps out which picture card is theirs and the enemy teams.
				The spymaster must then use a word and a number to try to direct
				their fellow spies to their own team's pictures. After guessing
				the picture cards, the next team's spy master can go and this
				cycle goes on. The first team to gets all their cards first
				wins. Is that a good explanation? Probably not, but hey, it's
				the effort that matters :D
			</p>

			<p>Okay, enough of talking, let's talk development</p>

			<h3>Development thoughts</h3>

			<p>
				Originally, my church have planned to play it through a
				conferencing app like Zoom with someone share screening the
				image capture of the array of images and manual revealing.
				Albeit a good enough solution, there are some limitations to
				this method.
			</p>

			<p>Limitations of a Zoom Codenames session:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Can't have multiple session</li>
				<li>Requires a game master to faciliate the game</li>
				<li>
					Game master's reaction time does not provide immediate
					feedback
				</li>
				<li>
					Very hard to communicate as they can't point with the
					fingers (I mean... it is a virtual setting...)
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				From these limitations, I drew up my requirements:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Accessible to everyone at anytime (not platform specific)
				</li>
				<li>Realtime updates of the game</li>
				<li>Multiple room sessions</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				With these requirements, my solution was a web app running on a
				node.js server to serve a react frontend with socket.io for
				communications.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have deemed that linking up to the website itself would be
				illegal? Linking it to the source code is also illegal... So
				I've decided that the best course of action is just to put in
				pictures!
			</p>

			<h3>Implementation</h3>

			<p>When you go to the hypothetical (cough, cough) site</p>
			<img
				id="blogImg"
				class="img-big"
				src="/assets/codenames_online/sudo-signup-page.jpg"
				alt="Sign up page"
				srcset=""
			/>
			<p class="img-small__caption">Sudo sign up page</p>
			<p>
				After you have finish giving yourself a nickname and typing in
				the room number, you go to team select
			</p>
			<img
				class="img-big"
				src="/assets/codenames_online/team-select.jpg"
				alt="Selecting teams"
				srcset=""
			/>
			<p class="img-small__caption">Team Select</p>
			<p>
				Here in the team select, you can decide which team you want to
				be in and if you want to be the spymaster of the team or not.
				Once you're ready, you can press on the "I'm ready!" button to
				ready yourself
			</p>
			<img
				src="/assets/codenames_online/team-select-2.jpg"
				class="img-big"
				alt="Team select UIs"
				alt=""
			/>
			<p class="img-small__caption">Everyone is getting ready!</p>
			<p>When everyone is ready, they then transition to games mode</p>
			<img
				src="/assets/codenames_online/spy-view.jpg"
				alt="Spy view"
				class="img-big"
			/>
			<p class="img-small__caption">Spy view</p>
			<p>If you are the spymaster, you can see more stuff</p>
			<img
				src="/assets/codenames_online/spymaster-view.jpg"
				class="img-big"
				alt="Spy Master view"
			/>
			<p class="img-small__caption">Spy master view</p>
			<p>You can then click on stuff to annotate it</p>
			<img
				src="/assets/codenames_online/annotation.jpg"
				alt="Annotation"
				class="img-big"
			/>
			<p class="img-small__caption">Annotation of picture</p>
			<p>
				And once you are confident that's the picture, the spymaster can
				reveal the card's identity
			</p>
			<img
				src="/assets/codenames_online/selection.jpg"
				alt="Selection"
				class="img-big"
			/>
			<p class="img-small__caption">
				Spy master select the confirmed picture
			</p>
			<img
				src="/assets/codenames_online/reveal.jpg"
				alt="Reveal"
				class="img-big"
			/>
			<p class="img-small__caption">Spy master reveals the identity</p>
			<p>
				This cycle repeats until one of the team wins, then they can
				either continue to the next board, go back to team select or
				realised that there is more to life that playing games... maybe
				start working out... or get a hobby...
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is the link to prove that it is not a gimmic, and it runs
				in sudo-real-time:
